# üöÄ Staging and Production Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow automates the release process and deployment to both **Staging** and **Production** environments. It is designed to streamline the release pipeline, ensuring reliable and efficient deployment.

## üìù Workflow Overview

1. **Release Creation**:
   - Automatically triggered when a pull request is closed or manually through `workflow_dispatch`.
   - Uses [release-please-action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) to generate a new release.

2. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Deploys the release to the **Staging environment**.
   - Ensures the release is validated in a pre-production environment.

3. **Production Deployment**:
   - Deploys the release to the **Production environment**.
   - Runs only after a successful Staging deployment.


## üìÇ Workflow Structure

### Trigger
- Pull Request closure (`types: closed`).
- Manual dispatch (`workflow_dispatch`).

### Jobs
1. **`release`**:
   - Generates a release using `release-please`.
2. **`deploy-staging`**:
   - Deploys to the **Staging environment**.
   - Triggered only if a release is successfully created.
3. **`deploy-production`**:
   - Deploys to the **Production environment**.
   - Triggered only after a successful Staging deployment.
